    <h4>Abstract</h4>
    <div class="box box_pure">
      <p>
        CDUST is an innovative Web3 mining game built on the Solana blockchain. It combines virtual
        cryptocurrency mining with engaging gameplay mechanics. This document outlines the CDUST system, its
        tokenomics, and the game mechanics that create a unique, sustainable, and potentially rewarding
        experience for users in the cryptocurrency space.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h4>1. Introduction</h4>
    <div class="box box_pure">
      <p>
        The rise of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies has opened new opportunities for gamification in
        the financial sector. CDUST leverages this potential by creating a virtual mining ecosystem on the
        Solana blockchain. Users can participate in cryptocurrency mining directly through a website, without
        the need for physical mining hardware.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h4>Registration and Hash Power</h4>
    <div class="box box_pure">
      <p>
        Users join the CDUST ecosystem by registering through the official website. After registration, the
        system generates a unique mining wallet for each user. The core resource for mining is Hash Power, which
        is acquired by depositing SOL under the following terms:
      </p>
      <ul class="typo-marked-list">
        <li>0.1 SOL = 100 Hash Power</li>
        <li>Minimum deposit: 0.105 SOL (including a 0.005 SOL transaction fee)</li>
        <li>Hash Power is valid for 24 hours and must be renewed daily.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h4>Block Generation and Mining</h4>
    <div class="box box_pure">
      <p>
        CDUST maintains a stable generation of 1,200 blocks daily.
      </p>
      <ul class="typo-marked-list">
        <li>Block processing time is 1-2 minutes, ensuring a steady mining pace.</li>
        <li>Each mined block distributes CDUST tokens to active miners proportionally to their Hash Power share in the network.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h4>Reward Distribution and Claiming</h4>
    <div class="box box_pure">
      <p>
        Accumulated CDUST tokens can be claimed every 15 minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tokens are automatically sent to the withdrawal address specified by the user.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h4>Total Supply and Distribution</h4>
    <div class="box box_pure">
      <p>
        The CDUST ecosystem has a fixed total supply of 1,000,000,000 CDUST, distributed as follows:
      </p>
      <ul class="typo-marked-list">
        <li>750,000,000 CDUST (75%) — allocated for mining rewards</li>
        <li>150,000,000 CDUST (15%) — allocated for DEX and CEX liquidity</li>
        <li>100,000,000 CDUST (10%) — allocated for community and marketing rewards</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h4>Risks and Disclaimer</h4>
    <div class="box box_pure">
      <ul class="typo-marked-list">
