    <h4>Abstract</h4>
    <div class="box box_pure">
      <p>
        CDUST is an innovative Web3 mining platform built on the Solana blockchain, allowing users to convert unused
        tokens (crypto dust) into mining power and earn CDUST. This document outlines the CDUST system, tokenomics, and
        game mechanics that create a unique, sustainable, and potentially profitable experience for cryptocurrency
        users.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <div class="box box_pure">
      <p>
        The evolution of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies has opened new opportunities for gamification in the
        financial sector. CDUST leverages this potential by creating a virtual mining ecosystem on the Solana
        blockchain. Users can participate in cryptocurrency mining through the website without requiring physical mining
        equipment.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h4>Registration and Purchasing Mining Power</h4>
    <div class="box box_pure">
      <p>
        Users join the CDUST ecosystem by registering on the official website. After registration, the system generates
        a unique mining wallet. The primary resource for mining is Hash Power (HP), which is acquired as follows:
      </p>
      <ul class="typo-marked-list">
        <li><span class="typo-strong">Purchase the HP token on the <a class="typo-link" href="https://pump.fun/board" target="_blank">Pump.fun</a> platform</span> via our website.</li>
        <li><span class="typo-strong">Send HP to the designated mining wallet;</span> once transferred, the tokens are burned, and mining begins.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h4>Block Generation and Mining Process</h4>
    <div class="box box_pure">
      <p>
        CDUST maintains a stable generation of 1,200 blocks daily:
      </p>
      <ul class="typo-marked-list">
        <li>Block processing time: <span class="typo-strong">1-2 minutes</span>, ensuring a steady mining pace.</li>
        <li>Each mined block distributes <span class="typo-strong">CDUST</span> among active miners proportionally to their Hash Power (HP).</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h4>Reward Distribution</h4>
    <div class="box box_pure">
      <ul class="typo-marked-list">
        <li><span class="typo-strong">CDUST rewards are distributed every hour.</span></li>
        <li>Tokens are automatically sent to the user’s designated wallet.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h4>Total Supply and Token Distribution</h4>
    <div class="box box_pure">
      <p>
        CDUST has a fixed total supply of <span class="typo-strong">1,000,000,000 CDUST</span>, allocated as follows:
      </p>
      <ul class="typo-marked-list">
        <li><span class="typo-strong">750,000,000 CDUST (75%)</span> — allocated for mining rewards.</li>
        <li><span class="typo-strong">150,000,000 CDUST (15%)</span> — allocated for DEX and CEX liquidity.</li>
        <li><span class="typo-strong">100,000,000 CDUST (10%)</span> — allocated for community rewards and marketing.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h4>Risks and Disclaimer</h4>
    <div class="box box_pure">
      <ul class="typo-marked-list">
        <li>CDUST is a blockchain-based gaming platform designed for entertainment and engagement in the Web3 space.</li>
        <li>The CDUST token is not an investment asset and should not be purchased with expectations of financial returns.</li>
        <li>The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and participants risk losing their entire contribution.</li>

    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <div class="box box_pure">
      <p>
        CDUST introduces a novel approach to virtual mining, leveraging the Solana blockchain to create an engaging and potentially profitable experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        By integrating Web3 gaming with real blockchain mechanics, CDUST aims to build an active mining community while maintaining a sustainable and deflationary token economy.
